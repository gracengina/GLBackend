# CORS Configuration Fix for Evently Backend

## Problem
Frontend at `http://127.0.0.1:5500` cannot access backend at `https://evently-avc4.onrender.com` due to CORS policy blocking the request.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Local Development CORS Configuration

**File: `src/main/resources/application.properties`**
```properties
app.cors.allowed-origins=${CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS:http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:8080,http://localhost:5173,http://127.0.0.1:3000,http://127.0.0.1:5500,http://127.0.0.1:5501,http://127.0.0.1:5502,http://127.0.0.1:8000,http://127.0.0.1:8080,http://192.168.*:*,http://10.0.*:*,https://*.onrender.com,https://*.netlify.app,https://*.vercel.app}
```

### 2. Enhanced WebConfig for Additional CORS Support

**File: `src/main/java/com/evently/config/WebConfig.java`**
- Added wildcard patterns for localhost and 127.0.0.1 on any port
- Added specific mapping for `/auth/**` endpoints
- Supports all common development ports

### 3. Updated SecurityConfig

**File: `src/main/java/com/evently/config/SecurityConfig.java`**
- Added `http://localhost:*` and `http://127.0.0.1:*` patterns
- Enhanced CORS configuration to handle more development scenarios

## For Production Deployment (Render)

### Option 1: Set Environment Variables on Render
In your Render dashboard, set the environment variable:
```
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://127.0.0.1:5500,http://127.0.0.1:5501,http://localhost:5500,https://your-frontend-domain.com,*
```

### Option 2: Quick Fix - Allow All Origins (Development Only)
If you want to temporarily allow all origins for testing, you can set:
```
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=*
```

**⚠️ Warning**: Never use `*` in production with credentials enabled.

### Option 3: Update Your Frontend Code
If your frontend is served from a specific domain, make sure to include it in the CORS origins.

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Local Testing
1. Restart your local Spring Boot application
2. Your frontend should now be able to access `http://localhost:8080/auth/login`

### 2. Production Testing
1. Update the environment variables on Render
2. Redeploy your application on Render
3. Your frontend should now be able to access `https://evently-avc4.onrender.com/auth/login`

## Key Changes Made

✅ **Added `http://127.0.0.1:5500`** to allowed origins
✅ **Added wildcard patterns** for common development ports
✅ **Enhanced WebConfig** with additional CORS mappings
✅ **Updated SecurityConfig** with more flexible patterns
✅ **Added production-ready patterns** for common hosting platforms

## Verification
The application log should show:
```
Configuring CORS with allowed origins: http://localhost:3000, http://localhost:8080, http://localhost:5173, http://127.0.0.1:3000, http://127.0.0.1:5500, http://192.168.*:*, http://10.0.*:*
```

## Next Steps
1. **For Local Development**: The fix is already applied and should work immediately
2. **For Production**: Set the `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable on Render with your specific frontend domains
3. **Test Both**: Verify that both local and production endpoints work correctly

## Additional Notes
- The configuration supports both HTTP (development) and HTTPS (production)
- Wildcards are used for flexible IP and port configurations
- Credentials are enabled for authenticated requests
- Preflight requests (OPTIONS) are properly handled
